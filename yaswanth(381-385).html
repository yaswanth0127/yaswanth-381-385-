    <p>employees. The human resources data that is available within organizations has the
            potential to help support their decision-making processes. The challenge is identifying
            useful information in vast human resources databases that are the result of the automa-tion of HR-related transaction processing.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data mining may be regarded as an evolving approach to data analysis in very large
                databases that could become a useful tool to HR professionals. Data mining involves
                extracting knowledge based on patterns of data in very large databases. Yet, data mining
                goes beyond simply performing data analysis on large data sets. Organizations that
                employ thousands of employees and track a multitude of employment-related information
                might find valuable information patterns contained within their databases to provide
                insights in such areas as employee retention and compensation planning. To develop
                an understanding of the potential of data mining HR information in a firm, this chapter
                will first discuss how HR-related information contributes to a firm’s competitive advan-tage. Next, we will discuss the components of Human Resource Information Systems
                (HRIS) and gain an understanding of the steps in the data-mining process. Finally, we
                will identify opportunities as well as concerns in applying data-mining techniques to HR
                Information Systems.</p>

                <h3>Building a Competitive Advantage
                </h3>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The resource-based view of the firm posits that organizational resources and
                    capabilities that are simultaneously rare, valuable, non-substitutable, and imperfectly
                    imitable form the basis for a firm’s sustainable competitive advantage (Barney,1991). If
                    a firm is able to uniquely manage its most valuable asset—its people— then it may be
                    able to differentiate itself from the competition to create an advantage. Boxall (1993)
                    suggests HR management can create a sustained competitive advantage by “hiring and
                    developing talented staff and ‘synergizing’ their contributions within the resource
                    bundle of the firm (p. 66).” Huselid, Jackson, and Schuler (1997) found investments in
                    a firm’s human resources are a potential source of competitive advantage in their
                    examination of HR effectiveness. However, many organizations lack the management
                    know-how or the information necessary to make strategic human resource decisions.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The competitive advantage is sustained if other firms are unable to imitate their
                        resources. The management of a firm’s human resources is often less susceptible to
                        imitation because competitors rarely have access to a firm’s HR management practices,
                        as these practices are not transparent to those outside of the company (Pfeffer, 1994).
                        For this reason, effective HR management provides a unique opportunity for firms to
                        establish a sustainable competitive position. One step in the process of developing a
                        firm’s human resources involves planning. Human resource planning goes hand in hand
                        with an organization’s strategic planning. As a firm develops its business strategy, it
                        must consider the abilities of its staff to meet its strategy. As a firm identifies its strategy,
                        HR must then ensure the strategy’s success by ensuring the right HR resources are in
                        place. HR must collect, store, and analyze data to move forward in the planning process.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All organizations collect data about their employees. However, the actions taken
                            with that data varies widely among organizations. Some organizations use the data only
                            </p>
                        <p>to perform required administrative tasks. Others transform the data into useful informa-tion for support in decision making (Kovach & Cathcart, 1999). Using HR data in
                            decisionmaking provides a firm with the opportunity to make more informed strategic
                            decisions. If a firm can extract useful or unique information on the behavior and potential
                            of its people from HR data, it can contribute to the firm’s strategic planning process.
                            Another type of information a firm may seek is the evaluation of the effectiveness of its
                            HR practices. Often a firm implements a recruiting source or training program, for example,
                            without any clear method of evaluating the practice. Analyzing the data collected in the
                            implementation and management of an HR practice can provide another resource for HR-related decisionmaking.</p>
                            <h3>Human Resource Information Systems
                            </h3>    
                            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many organizations today have purchased or designed databases to collect,
                                manage, and retrieve human resource-related data. As stated earlier, a HRIS serves two
                                primary purposes. The first purpose is administrative in nature. In order to conduct basic
                                human resource transactions such as payroll, benefits administration, and government
                                reporting, organizations must collect basic personal and work-related data. The second
                                purpose is to support organizational decisionmaking (Kovach & Cathcart., 1999) A HRIS
                                is often an expensive investment for a firm, and the ability to use the data collected
                                beyond only administrative issues can help justify that investment.</p>
                                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The HR information systems of most organizations today feature relational database systems that allow data to be stored in separate files that can be linked by common
                                    elements such as name or identification number. The relational database provides
                                    organizations with the ability to keep a virtually limitless amount of data on employees.
                                    It also allows organizations to access the data in a variety of ways. For example, a firm
                                    can retrieve data on a particular employee or it can retrieve data on a certain group of
                                    employees through conducting a search based on a specific parameter such as job
                                    classification. The development of relational databases in organizations along with
                                    advances in storage technology has resulted in organizations collecting a large amount
                                    of data on employees</p>

                                        in an HRIS. Table 2 outlines some typical functional uses of the data. Every organization</p>

                                            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Organizations also use data stored in their HRIS to make calculations to evaluate
                                                the financial impact of their HR-related practices. HR functions use this type of
                                                information to support the continued development of HR programs and also demonstrate
                                                to managers how HR can help impact the bottom line. Some examples of these kinds of
                                                calculations are pay and benefits as a percent of operating expense, cost per hire, return
                                                on training, and turnover cost (Fitz-Enz, 1998).

                                                    bottom-line impact of HR practices is not always so clear. One can evaluate the cost
                                                    per hire, but does that information provide any reference to the value of that hire? Should
                                                    a greater value be assessed to an employee who stays with the organization for an
                                                    extended period of time? Most data analysis retrieved from HRIS does not provide an
                                                    opportunity to seek out additional relationships beyond those that the system was
                                                    originally designed to identify.

                                                    1996). For example, if an HR professional is interested in analyzing the cost of turnover,
                                                    he or she might have to extract data from several different sources, such as accounting
                                                    records, termination reports, and personnel hiring records. That data is then combined,
                                                    reconciled, and evaluated. This process creates many opportunities for errors. As
                                                    business databases have grown in size, the traditional approach has grown more
                                                    impractical. Data mining is the process of extracting information from really large data
                                                    sets through the use of algorithms and techniques drawn from the fields of statistics,
                                                    machine learning, and database management (Feelders, Daniels, & Holsheimer, 2000).
                                                    Data mining has been used successfully in many functional areas such as finance and
                                                    marketing. HRIS applications in many organizations provide an as yet unexplored
                                                    opportunity to apply data-mining techniques. These systems typically hold a large
                                                    amount of data —a requirement for data mining. While most applications provide
                                                    opportunities to generate adhoc or standardized reports from specific sets of data, the

                                                    Several years ago, one of the authors worked in a university office of institutional
                                                    research and studies. This office was charged with various queries, reporting, and
                                                    decision-support assignments involving both students and personnel. Quite often, data
                                                    was needed over a period of years for these projects. However, data files for previous
                                                    years were difficult to locate and manipulate. Also, inconsistencies of various kinds tend
                                                    to occur from year to year. For example, code systems and category definitions tend to
                                                    mutate as time goes by. Similar problems have been experienced in most other organi-zations as well. Such projects were often practically impossible.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These problems led to the creation of special databases—typically relational
                                                    databases that are integrated, consistent, and multidimensional, with time being the
                                                    principal added dimension. When these special databases cover all of the data for an
                                                    organization, they are called data warehouses. When they cover just one functional area,
                                                    such as human resources, they are called datamarts. (See for example Agosta, 2000; Gray
                                                    & Watson, 1998; and Mallach, 2000). A data warehouse is essentially a separate,
                                                    customized repository of data for decision-support applications (Watson & Haley, 1998).
                                                    They are kept separate from operational data. Data warehouses are widely regarded as
                                                    a useful resource to consolidate corporate information and share it among organizational
                                                    entities for the purpose of analysis and decision-making support (Subramanian, Smith,
                                                    Nelson, Campbell, & Bird, 1997). This can be a costly endeavor, and the investment may
                                                    not be worthwhile depending on the use an organization expects. The decision to enable
                                                    data mining often necessitates at least the implementation of a datamart. Companies who
                                                    have implemented enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems will often find this facility
                                                    to be included with the ERP system, which itself can be quite expensive and time-consuming. However, without at least a datamart, if not a comprehensive data ware-house, data-mining projects would be doomed to laborious preliminary data collection,
                                                    editing, and formatting.

                                                </h3>
                                                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is worth reviewing here the connections and differences between data mining and
                                                    the more familiar activities of reports, queries, and routine statistical studies applied to
                                                    a database. Queries and reports (reports are usually based on queries) are structured
                                                    questions submitted to a database. For example, if an organization wanted to compare
                                                    information on two different groups of employees, queries would be needed to extract
                                                    the specific employees assigned to each group for further analysis. Thus, queries are
                                                    typically an essential step in extracting data from the database. Data warehouses and
                                                    datamarts greatly facilitate queries involving a time dimension. For example, trend
                                                    analysis and forecasts require historical data that would be hard to obtain without such
                                                    comprehensive databases. Such analysis might be applied to individual employee
                                                    histories as part of performance analysis. Trends in statistics relating to Equal Employ

                                                <p>ment Opportunity (EEO) could also be monitored in this way. In some respects, data
                                                    mining can be regarded as a set of very sophisticated queries that involve sampling and
                                                    statistical modeling. In any case, the additional query capabilities and uses should be
                                                    factored into the decisions on implementation of a data warehouse or datamart for data-mining use.

                                                    data-mining applications. Decision-support system applications are tools that allow
                                                    users to collect data from databases, analyze the data, and represent the analysis in many
                                                    forms, such as graphs and reports. These systems may use statistical modeling packages
                                                    to analyze data leading to information to support decisions in organizations. These
                                                    systems can combine information from other functional areas within the firm, such as
                                                    customer service and marketing, to help support human resource management decisions
                                                    (Broderick & Boudreau, 1992). For example, a user might build a statistical model to
                                                    analyze data such as time to fill service requests and time to delivery as they relate to
                                                    customer satisfaction levels. Information obtained from this analysis may then be used
                                                    to establish performance goals for employees. While decision-support system applications may provide useful information for decision-makers in organizations, very specific
                                                    analysis plans must be established. Essentially, the user must know what relationships
                                                    exist before analyzing the data. Further, several iterations of the model may have to be
                                                    tested before useful information can be identified.

                                                    research and studies (OIRS). This office was responsible for certain decision-support
                                                    and data-analysis studies that often involved university personnel. There was no
                                                    datamart at the time. It was necessary to create special files from current databases and
                                                    retain these year after year in order to do any kinds of longitudinal analyses. Special
                                                    statistical studies were sometimes possible if the right data had been collected. An
                                                    example was historical trends in Equal Opportunity Employment practices. Flexibility and
                                                    usefulness depended on the foresight of office analysts. If they had collected the right
                                                    data, then they would be able to respond to new requests from management, state and
                                                    federal agencies, and so on. It that foresight had not been in effect, it was necessary to
                                                    approximate or decline the information request, or to laboriously go through old files to
                                                    reconstruct a usable database. While this permitted some statistical studies to be carried
                                                    out, such limited access made data mining all but impossible. For specific statistical
                                                    studies, one focuses on a specific set of variables and questions. For data mining, one
                                                    essentially needs all the data to be accessible in a reasonably easy environment .and the
                                                    specific questions may not always be known precisely.</p>
                                                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Descriptive statistics were often reported, especially those based on the current
                                                    state of the system. Thus, it was possible for the OIRS to readily answer such questions
                                                    as the age distribution of current faculty, its ethnic distribution, and gender distribution.
                                                    However, to answer questions about trends in these data would require retaining the
                                                    corresponding data from year to year. Ordinarily, only a small number of such yearly data
                                                    sets might be retained. However, to make reasonable forecasts, for instance, a much
                                                    longer series of data is required. More importantly, data-mining questions aimed at
                                                    explaining the relationship of such trends to other variables in the system were practically
                                                    impossible. Thus, data mining seeks to go beyond the old days of ordinary statistical
                                                    reports showing only <i>what is.</i> It aims to find out more of the <i>how </i>and <i>why.</i>
